# Labby Icon Concepts

App name: **Labby**

## iOS App Icon Design Principles

- **Single focal element** - one shape, one idea
- **Bold silhouette** - must read at 60pt (smallest home screen size)
- **2-3 colors max** - usually a gradient background + one subject
- **No fine details** - LEDs, reflections, textures disappear at small sizes
- **Squint test** - if you squint and can't identify it, it's too complex

Reference icons: Slack (4 dots), Spotify (3 curves), Bear (head silhouette), Discord (simple face)
